# Project Overview
Project Title: Data Visualization - Empowering Business with Effective Insights

Project Description: This project aims to demonstrate the power of data visualization in empowering businesses with effective insights. Using a sample dataset, I created interactive dashboards and reports to showcase key trends, patterns, and correlations. The project was completed as part of the TCS Job Simulation program on Forage.

# Data Source
The dataset used for this project was provided by Forage as part of the TCS Job Simulation program. The dataset contains 541910 rows and 8 columns, covering various aspects of business operations.

# Tools
1. Microsoft Power BI
2. Excel

# Data Cleaning and Preparation
The dataset was cleaned and prepared using Excel, involving the following steps:
1. Handling missing values
2. Data normalization
3. Data transformation

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Analysis
EDA was performed using Power BI to understand the distribution of variables, identify correlations, and visualize key trends. Data analysis involved creating interactive dashboards and reports to showcase insights.
